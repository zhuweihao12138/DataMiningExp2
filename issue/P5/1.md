# 56 feature request-Increase  Kafka streams support
I have a future request for getting changed data capture from kafka streams when  having to query real-time data being from other databases in TuGraph.



I consider  adding third-party libraries  for TuGraph integration like librdkafka and increase kafka client for polling and executing 
cypher query.Would you hava plans to support Kafka Connector in future?
