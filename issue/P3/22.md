# 306 doc-Clarification_ Two versions of Browser (interface) 
Current TuGraph supports both new version interface (port number 8888) and old version (port 7090, or 7070?). Users may not know how to visit the other version, or which one to use. 

Expect some clarification in the documents, pointing out:

TODO 1. On some entry pages of docs, directly telling readers which port to use.

TODO 2. Solve this conflict:
(1) 7070: https://tugraph-db.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/3.quick-start/1.preparation.html
(2) 7090: https://tugraph-db.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/4.user-guide/2.tugraph-browser-legacy.html 

TODO 3. If needs to provide both docs:
(1) What are their differences? Functionality? Data format? Environment support?
(2) Which one should I use?

TODO 4. If I use the old version, when will it be deprecated? (supporting until which version)
