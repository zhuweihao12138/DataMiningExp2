# 351 doc-Optimize Graph Algorithm Documentation and Invocation Examples
[Graph Algorithm Documentation](https://tugraph-db.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5.developer-manual/6.interface/2.olap/6.algorithms.html) lacks invocation examples and API signatures for the algorithms, which makes it unclear to users what parameters are needed and how to call the algorithms.
