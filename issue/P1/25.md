# 590 比赛型issue-Does 'tugraph-db' support deployment on CentOS Stream 9
Due to EOL issues with certain versions of CentOS, the CentOS Stream 9 environment was installed.
May I ask if it is possible to deploy 'tugraph-db' on this OS environment,
If possible, what do I need to do.

For example, when using Docker deployment, do I need to modify the content of the Dockerfile file.
