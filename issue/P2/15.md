# 537 Add parser branch--for Enhancing parsing speed
## For enhancing parsing speed with multicore
We have introduced a multi-layer finite state machine, 

which serves as the basis for enhancing the speed of 
parallel processing of CSV files on single-machine multicore systems. 

SIMD instruction sets are used to obtain the bitmap as quickly as possible.

The main modifications are in file src/import/RecordSet.h, RecordLoader.h, RecordLoader.cpp, CSVPathParser.h and CSVPathParser.cpp.
