# 497 TuGraph's Cartesian product result is different from neo4j
Currently, TuGraph Cypher's cartesian product op uses the pattern graph to filter duplicate edges directly, so that the edges visited in each pattern will not be visited again by other patterns. This results in less than expected results (from neo4j)
