# 262 bug,cypher-Wrong Results for Triangle Query 
**Wrong Results for Triangle Query**
TuGraph 3.5.0 provided wrong results on Finding Triangles in a graph when executing cypher on web interface.

**To Reproduce**
I used tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7  with tag "latest", image ID 1152289e2d3e. 
And started this image by
`sudo docker run -d -p 7070:7070 -p 9090:9090 --name -v /mypath:/home/root/ tugraph_demo tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7 lgraph_server -c /mypath/lgraph.json `

My dataset is a randomly tag social network based on SNAP graph [LastFM](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/feather-lastfm-social.html). 
The graph files are  
[Person.csv](https://github.com/TuGraph-family/tugraph-db/files/12092625/Person.csv) 
[knows.csv](https://github.com/TuGraph-family/tugraph-db/files/12092630/knows.csv)
[import.config.txt](https://github.com/TuGraph-family/tugraph-db/files/12092632/import.config.txt)
Then i imported the graph by 
`lgraph_import --online false -c import.config.txt -d /mypath-to-data -g LastFM -u admin -p 73@TuGraph`
Then I log in localhost:7070, and executed a cypher query:
`match (p1:Person{community:0})-[:knows]-(p2:Person{community:1})-[:knows]-(p3:Person{community:2}), (p1)-[:knows]-(p3) RETURN DISTINCT p1.id,p2.id,p3.id ORDER BY p1.id,p2.id,p3.id;`
Tugraph generated a results, and said there are 21759 triangles:

However, there are only 3433 triangles, which is verified by at least 2 other graph database. 
For example, (13,1937,252) is a result tuple provided by tugraph. But there is no edge connecting Person 13 and Person 252.
