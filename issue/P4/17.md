# 198 bug,enhancement,cypher-[Performance] Simple COUNT can not return for large graph
**Describe the bug**
The simple `COUNT` for nodes can not return for a large graph.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Import a large graph to database, like hundreds millions nodes and billions edges
2. Run `MATCH (n) RETURN COUNT(n)`
3. The Cypher above may not return forever

**Expected behavior**
There maybe meta data about the graph in database so we can easily know the graph scale in my database.

**Environment:**
 - OS: CentOS 7.9/Official docker image 3.4.0
 - CPU: 16vCPU ECS

**Additional context**
In Neo4j, nodes count and edges count are almost displayed on the sidebar of current database and will be updated while importing data, even for large graph with billions nodes and edges.
