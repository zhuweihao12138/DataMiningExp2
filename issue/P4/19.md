# 179 doc-[Feature] Support complex parameter type in Cypher API
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

No.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Right now in Cypher API, we can not pass into a complex parameter type like an object with embedded data.

But this is very useful to update data with online API like I can send thousands records into a Cypher query as a parameter list and then do some query or update work with Cypher with `UNWIND`. But now I can not put lots of data in the parameter so I need to:

- Export data from online service to file with CSV format and import data by CLI tools.
- Write a plugin myself to update data in the plugin with procedure API.

Both ways above are not quite convenient for developers to handle data with online service.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

If we can not support complex parameter type in Cypher API, maybe we can provide some official plugins to do some common work like update vertex/edge by batch.
