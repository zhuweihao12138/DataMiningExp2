# 176 doc-[Doc] The installation doc is not identical and out of data
**Describe the bug**

The [installation doc](https://www.tugraph.org/doc?version=V3.3.2&id=10000000000842596) of TuGraph is not identical with the [quick start doc](https://www.tugraph.org/doc?version=V3.3.2&id=10000000000842594).

And the installation doc is out of date and has some errors in it, like:

- In the quick start doc, we can directly pull the image from docker hub, but in installation doc, we should download the image and load the image manually.
- In the docker run script, we should not run the container in interactive mode if we want to use `exec` to login into the container.
- There is no `port` setting in the script but there is a note about it. And I think we should always use `7070` as the default port, in the note message, it uses `7090` which is a little bit confusing.
- And the installation doc has no content about how to start the service, so I need to look into the [`Service operation` doc](https://www.tugraph.org/doc?version=V3.3.2&id=10000000000842599). But in that documentation, the commands are not suitable for container usage like I can't find a `./lgraph_server`, I should use `lgraph_server` directly.

I think the `Quick start` and `Installation` should be identical and there should be no error in the steps to start a service. And maybe in all the docs like `service operation`, they should always contain all envs like locally start or in container.

PS. It is really great if we put a sample `lgraph_config.json` file in the `/root` folder of the image.
