This filter is used to determine whether a given vertex should be included in the frontier. Specifically, the function iterates over the vertices, and for each vertex, it calls `root_vertex_filter` with the vertex iterator. If `root_vertex_filter` returns `true`, the vertex is added to the frontier; otherwise, it is excluded.\n\nIn summary, `root_vertex_filter` acts as a predicate to selectively include or exclude vertices from the frontier based on custom criteria defined by the user."}
