= Lcypher: Cypher for TuGraph

== openCypher
The Cypher Query Language Reference, Grammar specification, etc. we use are derived from openCypher. To learn more, please visit:

* http://www.opencypher.org[openCypher official]
* https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher.git[openCypher github]

The version we use is openCypher v1.0.0-M09 (now May 2018).

== Grammer
=== Difference between Lcypher & Cypher
* Label Number.
+
Lcypher: Each node/relationship must has one and only one label. So error occurs when there is no label, and
the 1st label will be picked as the label if there are more than one labels. +
Cypher: One node/relationship may have 0 to many labels.
* Label in NodePattern.
+
Lcypher: Label is necessary in NodePattern. e.g.
+
[source, cypher]
----
  MATCH (tom:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"}) RETURN tom
----
+
Cypher: Label(s) are not necessary. e.g.
+
[source, cypher]
----
  MATCH (tom {name: "Tom Hanks"}) RETURN tom
----
* Schema.
+
Lcypher: TuGraph has strong schema (for now, May 2018) +
Cypher: Neo4j is schema-less

=== Difference between Lcypher.g4 & https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/Cypher.g4[Cypher.g4]
* Rename lexer rule 'NULL' to 'NULL_'.
+
While it's ok when generating Java target, the C++ target goes wrong
with 'NULL' (for NULL is a keyword of C/C++)
* Hints
+
Lcypher extends oC_Hint to OpenCypher.
* [Note] "call" in "match"
+
The following queries will cause parse exception while they *should not*:
+
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (v:call) RETURN v
MATCH (v1)-[:call]->(v2) RETURN v2
----
+
`adaptivePredict` in `LcypherParser::oC_SingleQuery` throws exception.

== Implementation
=== Difference between TuGraph & Neo4j
* Contain Self.
+
TuGraph: In the following example, results contain _tom_ itself.
+
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (tom:Person {name:"Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coActors) RETURN coActors.name
----
+
Neo4j: Not so.
* Return Object.
+
When answering return objects(like 'RETURN tom'), Neo4j returns the whole data of the object, while TuGraph returns the IDs (vertex_id/<src_vid_, dst_vid, edge_id>).
* Variables duplicated declaration. For syntax see Reference Section "Expressions, variables and parameters".
+
Neo4j allows some forms of re-declarations, e.g.
+
[source, cypher]
----
// the following statement causes SyntaxError
CREATE (nm:Person {name:'Lana Wachowski', born:1965})
CREATE (nm:Person {name:'Joel Silver', born:1952})

// the following statement works fine
MATCH (nm {born: 1967}),(nm {name: "Meg Ryan"}) RETURN nm
----
+
Lcypher prohibits all forms of re-declarations.
* Expand Into [todo]
+
https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/execution-plans/operators/#query-plan-expand-into[Neo4j]:
When both the start and end node have already been found, the Expand(Into) operator is used to find all relationships connecting the two nodes.
(when there is circle in pattern graph)
+
TuGraph: Looks like `Expand(ALL)` + `NodeHashJoin` in Neo4j.
