# This file shows you how to build an embedding application using TuGraph. We assume you are
# building the application to debug a plugin. So the PLUGIN_CPP must be provided as the paramemter
# to this script.
#
# LG_INCLUDE must point to the include directory of TuGraph
# LG_LIB must point to the library path of TuGraph
#
# If everything runs smoothly, you will get an executable called `embed` which you can simply
# run or debug.
